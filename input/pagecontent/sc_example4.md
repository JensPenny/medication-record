### Dispense of prescribed medication, and dispense of a product that can be done without a prescription

This example shows a dispense of two products. One that has a prescription and other that does not (and does not need one).


* After a GP visit, the patient Pia Peters is prescribed Rosuvastatin 10 mg cp for cholesterol.
* After reaching the pharmacy, Crestor 10 is dispensed facing that prescription. Additionally, Dafalgan compr. 20x 500mg (OTC) is also dispensed due to a complaint of a minor toothache.
* This should result in two treatment lines. One with prescription and dispense and one with only dispense.
