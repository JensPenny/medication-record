### Dispense of medication that was prescribed, but not taken till the end

This example shows a prescription that is made by VOS and the pharmacist dispenses it. But at the time of administration, the treatment is stopped due to a reaction.

* After a GP visit, the patient Pia Peters is prescribed amoxicillin + clavulanic acid 875 mg + 125 mg for a pharyngitis for the conclusion of the package.
* The pharmacist, dispensed Amoxiclav Sandoz 875/125.
* However, after 1 take, the patient stopped doing the medication because the patient had an alergic reaction. 
* This should result in a medication summary that can group treatment lines, enabling the visualization of the prescription, dispenses and administrations next to each other.
